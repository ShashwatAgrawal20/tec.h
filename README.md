# TEC - Test C / Test Engine for C
TEC (Test C or Test Engine for C) is a lightweight, header-only testing library
designed to make C testing straightforward and efficient. It provides a clean
interface for writing and running unit tests with minimal setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> TEC is currently in the early stages of development, and while it is somewhat
> functional, it may still have some limitations and is subject to change.
> The primary focus of development is enabling support for multiple test files
> to replace the current single-file approach.
